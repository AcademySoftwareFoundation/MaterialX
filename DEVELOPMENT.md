# MaterialX Development Environment
## 1. Autodesk Fork 
- https://github.com/materialx/MaterialX
- This is where Autodesk specific additions to ASWF main fork reside.
- Any areas of core which are not part of main should be resolved. ADSK core and ASWF core should always be in sync per release.
- Additions include things like additional code generators, utilities etc.
- Branches:
    - The main branch should be kept up to date with ASWF main. Nothing ever gets merged back to this main branch.
    - The `adsk_contrib/dev` : is the main working branch
        - Tagged released corresponding to ASWF releases are based on this branch.
    - If and only if needed a new release branch can be created. Thus far this has never been done.

## 2. Status / Releases
- 	The general wiki is here (https://github.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX/wiki). Please keep this up to date.
- 	Every release of ASWF should have a corresponding ADSK release. The ASWF tag names are `v<major>.<minor><patch>`. The ASDK tag names include a prefix of `_adsk`.
    - Note that distributions are still manually added back in though possibly an action could be added for this.
    - E.g.

## 3. Contributing
### 3.1 Issues
- Before starting work, if non-trivial should be checked with ASWF gatekeepers. The ASWF #materialx Slack channel is a good place to start. This is for both implementations and required for specification changes.
- An issue can be raised either on the ASWF repo if a common item.

- If ADSK specific an issue can be added in the ADSK fork issue section.

    - Please add labels as appropriate, release number should be checked with the ADSK owner, and assignments added as needed. The ASWF repo has no labels at time of writing.
    - There is a [project Kanban board](https://github.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX/projects) which is automated.

### 3.2 Coding and Pull Requests
- 	All work in progress should have branch off of `adsk_contrib/dev` with a name `adsk_contrib/<name of work>` if origin is from ADSK.
- 	All work if possible, should be relative to ASWF main. The easiest thing to do is update ADSK `main` and create a branch off of it.
- 	PRâ€™s when ready should be directly against ASWF main though it can be committed to the ADSK branch first for CI/CD testing

- All pull requrests  
    - Should include a reference a github issue and/or ADSK JIRA issue as applicable.
    - Should include at least **one** reviewer. ASWF members should be added as necessary if this is a PR for pre-review.
    - Should have a release tag for tracking.
    - Should update the CHANGELOG.md file as neee.
    - **Needs to set the project manually** (The automatic project addition feature appears to not work currently).
    - Should add a unit test for any fix or new functionality. 
    - Must pass CI/CD workflow.
- When closing a PR please squash and merge, then delete the branch.
- ASWF main repo owners (Jonathan Stone currently) should be notified of any PRs to merge into ASWF main. This can be done via ASWF Slack.
  ASWF main repo owners will perform the merge. 

## 4. CI/CD and other Automated Processes
- ADSK has a slight variation on Github actions in that not all configurations are configuration for a push commit.
- A PR will trigger the exact same pipeline as the ASWF one.
  - PRs are hooked up to Codacy for static analysis.
  - There is only one workflow file (main.yml) which handles desktop and web CI.

- The web CI will update the associated github page on PRs.

- `dependabot` is used to check and automatically create PRs for package dependency security issues. Admins can control the configuration of this.
