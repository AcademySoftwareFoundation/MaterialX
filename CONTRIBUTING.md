# Contributing to MaterialX

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MaterialX!  This document explains our contribution process and procedures.

## Community and Discussion

There are two primary ways to connect with the MaterialX community:

* The MaterialX channel of the [Academy Software Foundation Slack](http://academysoftwarefdn.slack.com/).  This platform is appropriate for general questions, feature requests, and discussion of the MaterialX project as a whole.  You can request an invitation to join the Academy Software Foundation Slack at https://slack.aswf.io/.
* The [Issues](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/MaterialX/issues) panel of the MaterialX GitHub, which is used to report and discuss bugs and build issues.

## Contributor License Agreements

To contribute to MaterialX, you must sign a Contributor License Agreement through the *EasyCLA* system, which is integrated with GitHub as a pull request check.

Prior to submitting a pull request, you can sign the form through [this link](https://contributor.easycla.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/#/cla/project/68fa91fe-51fe-41ac-a21d-e0a0bf688a53/user/564e571e-12d7-4857-abd4-898939accdd7).  If you submit a pull request before the form is signed, the EasyCLA check will fail with a red *NOT COVERED* message, and you'll have another opportunity to sign the form through the provided link.

* If you are an individual writing the code on your own time and you're sure you are the sole owner of any intellectual property you contribute, you can sign the CLA as an Individual Contributor.
* If you are writing the code as part of your job, or if your employer retains ownership to intellectual property you create, then your company's legal affairs representatives should sign a Corporate Contributor License Agreement.  If your company already has a signed CCLA on file, ask your local CLA manager to add you to your company's approved list.

The MaterialX CLAs are the standard forms used by Linux Foundation projects and [recommended by the ASWF TAC](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/tac/blob/main/process/contributing.md#contributor-license-agreement-cla).

## Coding Conventions

Please follow the coding convention and style in each file and in each library when adding new files.  For convenience, you can use the included [clang-format](.clang-format) file to automatically align new source files with MaterialX coding conventions.
