# Shader Generation Test Suite

The sub-folders in the test suite contain a set of input MaterialX documents. During execution of the test suite, each file is parsed to determine renderable elements.  For each element the appropriate shader generator is used to produced source code.

## Folder layout

- The main grouping of input files is by library: ([stdlib](stdlib) and [pbrlib](pbrlib)).
- Additional sub-folders group documents based on Element group or category. For example math tests are found in [stdlib/math](stdlib/math)), with:
    - `math.mtlx`
    - `math_operators.mtlx`
    - `transform.mtlx`
    - `trig.mtlx`, and
    - `vector_math.mtlx`

  documents containing the various Elements to test.
- It is possible to add additional tests by simply adding new MaterialX documents under the TestSuite sub-folder.
- The [Lights](Utilities/Lights) folder provides a sample configuration of hardware lights for usage by hardware shader generators.
