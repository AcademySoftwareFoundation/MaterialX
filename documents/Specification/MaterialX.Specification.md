# Introduction

Computer graphics production studios commonly use workflows involving multiple software tools for different parts of the production pipeline.  There is also a significant amount of sharing and outsourcing of work across facilities, requiring companies to hand off fully look-developed models to other divisions or studios which may use different software packages and rendering systems.  In addition, studio rendering pipelines that previously used monolithic shaders built by expert programmers or technical directors with fixed, predetermined texture-to-shader connections and hard-coded texture color-correction options are now using more flexible node-based shader networks built up by connecting images and procedurals to shader inputs through a graph of image processing and blending operators.

At least four distinct interrelated data relationships are required to specify the complete "look" of a CG object:

1. _Image processing networks_ of sources, operators, connections and input values, outputting a number of spatially-varying data streams.
2. _Geometry-specific information_ such as associated texture filenames or IDs for various map types.
3. Associations between spatially-varying data streams and/or uniform values and the inputs of surface, volume, or other shaders, defining a number of _materials_.
4. Associations between materials and specific geometries to create a number of _looks_.

**MaterialX** addresses the need for an open, platform-independent, well-defined standard for specifying the "look" of computer graphics objects built using node networks by defining a material content schema along with a corresponding XML-based file format to read and write MaterialX content.  The MaterialX schema defines a number of primary element types plus several supplemental and sub-element types, as well as a set of **standard nodes** with specific functionality for defining data-processing graphs, shaders and materials.

This document describes the core MaterialX specification.  Companion documents [**MaterialX Standard Nodes**](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md), [**MaterialX Physically Based Shading Nodes**](./MaterialX.PBRSpec.md) and [**MaterialX NPR Shading Nodes**](./MaterialX.NPRSpec.md) describe the standard mathematical, pattern and shading nodes of MaterialX, while companion documents [**MaterialX Geometry Extensions**](./MaterialX.GeomExts.md) and [**MaterialX Supplemental Notes**](./MaterialX.Supplement.md) describe additional element types and other information about the library, while [**MaterialX: Proposed Additions and Changes**](./MaterialX.Proposals.md) describes forward-looking proposed functionality for MaterialX.

# MaterialX Overview

The diagram below gives a high-level overview of a typical MaterialX look definition.  A directed acyclic graph of pattern generation and processing nodes is connected to inputs of a surface Shader which defines a layered BSDF response.  One or more shaders can be connected to form a Material, which is ultimately associated with specific scene geometry via a MaterialAssign, a number of which comprise a Look.  The assignments of Materials to geometries can be defined within a MaterialX document in applications supporting MaterialX Geometry Extensions, or using an alternative mechanism such as USD[^1] or a native application's toolset.  Each of the pattern nodes and even the Shaders may in turn be implemented using a graph of nodes: these NodeGraphs are given a parameter interface using NodeDefs, and these implementations may be reused with different input values just like any other Standard node defined by MaterialX.

![MaterialX Overview Diagram](media/MaterialX_1.39_Overview_v5.png "MaterialX Overview Diagram")

MaterialX also allows the specification of additional information not shown in this diagram, such as geometry-specific properties, material variations, arbitrary custom inputs and attributes for nodes, rendering-target-specific versions of shaders, nodes and implementations, external compiled or generated shader implementations, and much more.



## Definitions

Because the same word can be used to mean slightly different things in different contexts, and because each studio and package has its own vocabulary, it's important to define exactly what we mean by any particular term in this proposal and use each term consistently.

An **Element** is a named object within a MaterialX document, which may possess any number of child elements and attributes.  An **Attribute** is a named property of a MaterialX element.

A **Node** is a function that generates or operates upon spatially-varying data.  This specification provides a set of standard nodes with precise definitions, and also supports the creation of custom nodes for application-specific uses.  The interface for a node’s incoming data is declared through **Inputs**, which may be spatially-varying or uniform, and **Tokens**, which are string values that can be substituted into filenames declared in node inputs.

A **Pattern** is a node that generates or processes simple scalar, vector, and color data, and has access to local properties of any geometry that has been bound.

A **Shader** is a node that can generate or process arbitrary lighting or BSDF data, and has access to global properties of the scene in which it is evaluated.  

A **Material** is a node which internally or externally references one or more shaders with specific data streams or uniform values bound to their inputs.

A **Node Graph** is a directed acyclic graph of nodes, which may be used to define arbitrarily complex generation or processing networks.  Common uses of Node Graphs are to describe a network of pattern nodes flowing into shader inputs, or to define a complex or layered node in terms of simpler nodes.

A **Stream** refers to a flow of spatially-varying data from one node to another.  A Stream most commonly consists of color, vector, or scalar data, but can transport data of any standard or custom type.

A **Layer** is a named 1-, 2-, 3- or 4-channel color "plane" within an image file. Image file formats that do not support multiple or named layers within a file should be treated as if the (single) layer was named "rgba".

A **Channel** is a single float value within a color or vector value, e.g. each layer of an image might have a red Channel, a green Channel, a blue Channel and an alpha Channel.

A **Geometry** is any renderable object, while a **Partition** refers to a specific named renderable subset of a piece of geometry, such as a face set.

A **Collection** is a recipe for building a list of geometries, which can be used as a shorthand for assigning e.g. a Material to a number of geometries in a Look.

A **Target** is a software environment that interprets MaterialX content to generate images, with common examples being digital content creation tools and 3D renderers.



## MaterialX Names

All elements in MaterialX (nodes, materials, shaders, etc.) are required to have a `name` attribute of type "string".  The `name` attribute of a MaterialX element is its unique identifier, and no two elements within the same scope (i.e. elements with the same parent) may share a name.

Element names are restricted to upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and underscores (“_”) from the ASCII character set; all other characters and symbols are disallowed.  MaterialX names are case-sensitive and are not allowed to begin with a digit.



## MaterialX Data Types

All values, input and output ports, and streams in MaterialX are strongly typed, and are explicitly associated with a specific data type.  The following standard data types are defined by MaterialX:

**Base Types**:

```
    integer, boolean, float,
    color3, color4,
    vector2, vector3, vector4,
    matrix33, matrix44, string, filename
```

**Array Types**:

```
    integerarray, floatarray,
    color3array, color4array,
    vector2array, vector3array, vector4array,
    stringarray
```


The following examples show the appropriate syntax for MaterialX attributes in MTLX files:

**Integer**, **Float**: just a value inside quotes:

```
    integervalue = "1"
    floatvalue = "1.0"
```

**Boolean**: the lower-case word "true" or "false" inside quotes:

```
    booleanvalue = "true"
```

**Color** types: MaterialX supports two different color types:

* color3 (red, green, blue)
* color4 (red, green, blue, alpha)

Color channel values should be separated by commas (with or without whitespace), within quotes:

```
    color3value = "0.1,0.2,0.3"
    color4value = "0.1,0.2,0.3,1.0"
```

Note: all color3 values and the RGB components of a color4 value are presumed to be specified in the "working color space" defined in the enclosing &lt;materialx> element, although any element within a document may provide a `colorspace` attribute that explicitly states the space in which color values within its scope should be interpreted; implementations are expected to translate those color values into the working color space before performing computations with those values.  See the [Color Spaces and Color Management Systems](#color-spaces-and-color-management-systems) section below.

**Vector** types: similar to colors, MaterialX supports three different vector types:

* vector2 (x, y)
* vector3 (x, y, z)
* vector4 (x, y, z, w)

Coordinate values should be separated by commas (with or without whitespace), within quotes:

```
    vector2value = "0.234,0.885"
    vector3value = "-0.13,12.883,91.7"
    vector4value = "-0.13,12.883,91.7,1.0"
```

While color<em>N</em> and vector<em>N</em> types both describe vectors of floating-point values, they differ in a number of significant ways.  First, the final channel of a color4 value is interpreted as an alpha channel by compositing operators, and is only meaningful within the [0, 1] range, while the fourth channel of a vector4 value _could be_ (but is not necessarily) interpreted as the "w" value of a homogeneous 3D vector.  Additionally, values of type color3 and color4 are always associated with a particular color space and are affected by color transformations, while values of type vector3 and vector4 are not.  More detailed rules for color<em>N</em> and vector<em>N</em> operations may be found in the [Standard Operator Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#standard-operator-nodes) section of the specification.

**Matrix** types: MaterialX supports two matrix types that may be used to represent geometric and color transforms.  The `matrix33` and `matrix44` types, respectively, represent 3x3 and 4x4 matrices and are written as nine or sixteen float values separated by commas, in row-major order:

```
    matrix33value = "1,0,0, 0,1,0, 0,0,1"
    matrix44value = "1,0,0,0, 0,1,0,0, 0,0,1,0, 0,0,0,1"
```

**String**: literal text within quotes.  See the [MTLX File Format Definition](#mtlx-file-format-definition) section for details on representing special characters within string data.

```
    stringvalue = "some text"
```

**Filename**: attributes of type "filename" are just strings within quotes, but specifically mean a Uniform Resource Identifier ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier)) optionally containing one or more Filename Substitution strings (see below) that represents a reference to an external asset, such as a file on disk or a query into a content management system.

```
    filevalue = "diffuse/color01.tif"
    filevalue = "/s/myshow/assets/myasset/v102.1/wetdrips/drips.{frame}.tif"
    filevalue = "https://github.com/organization/project/tree/master/src/node.osl"
    filevalue = "cmsscheme:myassetdiffuse.<UDIM>.tif?ver=current"
```

**IntegerArray**, **FloatArray**, **Color3Array**, **Color4Array**, **Vector2Array**, **Vector3Array**, **Vector4Array**, **StringArray**: any number of values (including zero) of the same base type, separated by commas (with or without whitespace), within quotes; arrays of color3’s, color4’s, vector2's, vector3's or vector4's are simply a 1D list of channel values in order, e.g. "r0, g0, b0, r1, g1, b1, r2, g2, b2".  Individual string values within stringarrays may not contain commas or semicolons, and any leading and trailing whitespace characters in them is ignored.  MaterialX does not support multi-dimensional or nested arrays.  Array-typed inputs to nodes must be static uniform values of a length specified by another uniform input value of the node, or implicitly by the node's implementation requirements.  Nodes cannot output an Array type.

```
    integerarrayvalue = "1,2,3,4,5"
    floatarrayvalue = "1.0, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5"
    color3arrayvalue = ".1,.2,.3, .2,.3,.4, .3,.4,.5"
    color4arrayvalue = ".1,.2,.3,1, .2,.3,.4,.98, .3,.4,.5,.9"
    vector2arrayvalue = "0,.1, .4,.5, .9,1.0"
    vector3arrayvalue = "-0.2,0.11,0.74, 5.1,-0.31,4.62"
    vector4arrayvalue = "-0.2,0.11,0.74,1, 5.1,-0.31,4.62,1"
    stringarrayvalue = "hello, there, world"
```



## Custom Data Types

In addition to the standard data types, MaterialX supports the specification of custom data types for the inputs and outputs of shaders and custom nodes.  This allows documents to describe data streams of any complex type an application may require; examples might include spectral color samples or compound geometric data.  The structure of a custom type's contents may be described using a number of <member> elements, though it is also permissible to only declare the custom type's name and treat the type as "blind data".

Types can be declared to have a specific semantic, which can be used to determine how values of that type should be interpreted, and how nodes outputting that type can be connected.  Currently, MaterialX defines three semantics:

* "`color`": the type is interpreted to represent or contain a color, and thus should be color-managed as described in the [Color Spaces and Color Management Systems](#color-spaces-and-color-management-systems) section.
* "`shader`": the type is interpreted as a shader output type; nodes or nodegraphs which output a type with a "shader" semantic can be used to define a shader-type node, which can be connected to inputs of "material"-type nodes.
* "`material`": the type is interpreted as a material output type; nodes or nodegraphs which output a type with a "material" semantic can be referenced by a &lt;materialassign> in a &lt;look>.

Types not defined with a specific semantic are assumed to have semantic="default".

Custom types are defined using the &lt;typedef> element:

```xml
  <typedef name="spectrum" semantic="color"/>
  <typedef name="texcoord_struct">
    <member name="s" type="float" value="0.0"/>
    <member name="t" type="float" value="0.0"/>
  </typedef>
```

Attributes for &lt;typedef> elements:

* `name` (string, required): the name of this type.  Cannot be the same as a built-in MaterialX type.  To reduce the possible symbol conflict between custom type names and possible variable names created by code generation, we suggest the convention of using `_struct` as a suffix to the type name.
* `semantic` (string, optional): the semantic for this type (see above); the default semantic is "default".
* `context` (string, optional): a semantic-specific context in which this type should be applied.  For "shader" semantic types, `context` defines the rendering context in which the shader output is interpreted; please see the [Shader Nodes](#shader-nodes) section for details.
* `inherit` (string, optional): the name of another type that this type inherits from, which can be either a built-in type or a custom type.  Applications that do not have a definition for this type can use the inherited type as a "fallback" type.
* `hint` (string, optional): A hint to help those creating code generators understand how the type might be defined.  The following hints for typedefs are currently defined:
    * "halfprecision": the values within this type are half-precision
    * "doubleprecision: the values within this type are double-precision

Attributes for &lt;member> elements:

* `name` (string, required): the name of the member variable. Must be unique within the list of other member names for this custom type.
* `type` (string, required): the type of the member variable; can be any built-in MaterialX type, or any previously defined custom type; recursive inclusion for &lt;member> types is not supported.
* `value` (string, required): the default value of the member variable.

If a number of <member> elements are provided, then a MaterialX file can specify a value for that type any place it is used, as a brace surrounded, semicolon-separated list of numbers and strings, with the expectation that the numbers and strings between semicolons exactly line up with the expected <member> types in order.  The use of the braces allows for custom struct types initializers to be nested.  For example, if the following <typedef> was declared:

```xml
  <typedef name="exampletype_struct">
    <member name="id" type="integer" value="2"/>
    <member name="compclr" type="color3" value="0.2,0.4,0.6"/>
    <member name="objects" type="stringarray" value="whiz,bang"/>
    <member name="minvec" type="texcoord_struct" value="{0.2,0.2}"/>
    <member name="maxvec" type="vector2" value="0.5,0.7"/>
  </typedef>
```

Then a permissible input declaration in a custom node using that type could be:

```xml
  <input name="in2" type="exampletype" value="{3; 0.18,0.2,0.11; foo,bar; {0.0,1.0}; 3.4,5.1}"/>
```

If <member> child elements are not provided, e.g. if the contents of the custom type cannot be represented as a list of MaterialX types, then a value cannot be provided, and this type can only be used to pass blind data from one custom node's output to another custom node or shader input.

Once a custom type is defined by a &lt;typedef>, it can then be used in any MaterialX element that allows "any MaterialX type"; the list of MaterialX types is effectively expanded to include the new custom type.  It should be noted however that the &lt;typedef> is only declaring the existence of the type and perhaps some hints about its intended definition, but it is up to each application and code generator to provide its own precise definition for any type.

The standard MaterialX distribution includes definitions for four "shader"-semantic data types: **surfaceshader**, **displacementshader**, **volumeshader**, and **lightshader**.  These types are discussed in more detail in the [Shader Nodes](#shader-nodes) section below.



## MTLX File Format Definition

An MTLX file (with file extension ".mtlx") has the following general form:

```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <materialx version="major.minor" [root-level attributes]>
    <!-- various combinations of MaterialX elements and sub-elements -->
  </materialx>
```

That is, a standard XML declaration line followed by a root &lt;materialx> element, which contains any number of MaterialX elements and sub-elements.  The default character encoding for MTLX files is UTF-8, and this encoding is expected for the in-memory representation of string values in MaterialX implementations.

Standard XML XIncludes are supported ([http://en/wikipedia.org/wiki/XInclude](http://en/wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinclude)), as well as standard XML comments and the XML character entities `&quot;`, `&amp;`, `&apos;`, `&lt;` and `&gt;`:

```xml
  <xi:include href="includedfile.mtlx"/>
  <!-- this is a comment -->
  <input name="example" type="string" value="&quot;text in quotes&quot;"/>
```

To support stringarray types, MaterialX supports a non-standard XML convention where a comma (and any following whitespace) is a separator for strings within a stringarray, a comma or semicolon preceded by a backslash is interpreted as a regular comma or semicolon rather than as a separator, and two backslashes are interpreted as a single backslash.

Each XIncluded document must itself be a valid MTLX file, containing an XML header and its own root `<materialx>` element, the children of which are added to the root element of the including document.  Hierarchical root-level attributes such as `colorspace` and `namespace` are distributed to the included children to maintain correct semantics within the including MaterialX document.

Attributes for a &lt;materialx> element:

* `version` (string, required): a string containing the version number of the MaterialX specification that this document conforms to, specified as a major and minor number separated by a dot.  The MaterialX library automatically upgrades older-versioned documents to the current MaterialX version at load time.
* `colorspace` (string, optional): the name of the "working color space" for this element and all of its descendants.  This is the default color space for all image inputs and color values, and the color space in which all color computations will be performed.  The default is "none", for no color management.
* `namespace` (string, optional): defines the namespace for all elements defined within this &lt;materialx> scope.  Please see the [MaterialX Namespaces](#materialx-namespaces) section below for details.



## Color Spaces and Color Management Systems

MaterialX supports the use of color management systems to associate RGB colors and images with specific color spaces.  MaterialX documents typically specify the working color space of the application that created them, and any input color or image described in the document can specify the name of its color space if different from the working color space.  This allows applications using MaterialX to transform color values within input colors and images from their original color space into a desired working color space upon ingest.  MaterialX does not specify _how_ or _when_ color values should be transformed: that is up to the host application, which can use any appropriate method including code generation, conversion when loading images into memory, maintaining cached or pre-converted image textures, etc.  It is generally presumed that the working color space of a MaterialX document will be linear (as opposed to log, a display-referred space such as sRGB, or some other non-linear encoding), although this is not a firm requirement.

By default, MaterialX supports the following color spaces as defined in ACES 1.2 ([http://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces)](http://www.oscars.org/science-technology/sci-tech-projects/aces), and applications rendering MaterialX documents are expected to transform input colors and images from these spaces to the color space of their renderer.  One straightforward option for providing this support is to leverage MaterialX code generators, which support these transforms automatically, but applications may use any appropriate means to handle the transforms on their own.

* `srgb_texture`
* `lin_rec709`
* `g22_rec709`
* `g18_rec709`
* `acescg`
* `lin_ap1 (alias for "acescg")`
* `g22_ap1`
* `g18_ap1`
* `lin_srgb`
* `adobergb`
* `lin_adobergb`
* `srgb_displayp3`
* `lin_displayp3`

The working color space of a MaterialX document is defined by the `colorspace` attribute of its root &lt;materialx> element, and it is strongly recommended that all &lt;materialx> elements define a specific `colorspace` if they wish to use a color-managed workflow rather than relying on a default color space setting from an external configuration file.  If a MaterialX document is xi:included into another MaterialX document, it will inherit the working color space setting of the parent document, unless it itself declares a specific working color space.

The color space of individual color image files and values may be defined via a `colorspace` attribute in an input which defines a filename or value.  Other elements, such as &lt;nodegraph> or a node instance, are allowed to define a `colorspace` attribute that will apply to elements within their scope; color values in inputs and files that do not explicitly provide a `colorspace` attribute will be treated as if they are in the color space of the nearest enclosing scope which does define a `colorspace` attribute.  Color images and values in spaces other than the working color space are expected to be transformed by the application into the working space before computations are performed.  In the example below, an image file has been defined in the “srgb_texture” color space, while its default value has been defined in “lin_rec709”; both should be transformed to the application’s working color space before being applied to any computations.

```xml
  <image name="in1" type="color3">
    <input name="file" type="filename" value="input1.tif"
         colorspace="srgb_texture"/>
    <input name="default" type="color3" value="0.5,0.5,0.5"
         colorspace="lin_rec709"/>
  </image>
```

MaterialX reserves the color space name "none" to mean no color space conversion should be applied to the images and color values within their scope, regardless of any differences between stated color spaces at the local scope and document or application working color space settings.



## Units

MaterialX allows floating-point and vector values to be defined in terms of a specific unit and unit type, and can automatically convert values from their specified unit into a scene unit of the same type specified by the application.  This allows images and the quantities they represent such as displacement amount to be specified at an absolute real-world size, and then be converted automatically to the expected scene units of the application.

Unit types are defined using a &lt;unittypedef> element, and a set of units of that type is defined using a &lt;unitdef> element with one or more child &lt;unit> elements.  The following unittypes and units are pre-defined by MaterialX:

```xml
  <unittypedef name="distance"/>
  <unitdef name="UD_stdlib_distance" unittype="distance">
    <unit name="nanometer" scale="0.000000001"/>
    <unit name="micron" scale="0.000001"/>
    <unit name="millimeter" scale="0.001"/>
    <unit name="centimeter" scale="0.01"/>
    <unit name="inch" scale="0.0254"/>
    <unit name="foot" scale="0.3048"/>
    <unit name="yard" scale="0.9144"/>
    <unit name="meter" scale="1.0"/>
    <unit name="kilometer" scale="1000.0"/>
    <unit name="mile" scale="1609.34"/>
  </unitdef>
  <unittypedef name="angle"/>
  <unitdef name="UD_stdlib_angle" unittype="angle">
    <unit name="degree" scale="1.0"/>
    <unit name="radian" scale="57.295779513"/>
  </unitdef>
```

The &lt;unittypedef> defines the name of a unittype, while the &lt;unitdef> defines any number of units for a unittype along with the multiplicative conversion `scale` values relative to the other units.  Additional unit definitions for any unit type may be done by providing another &lt;unitdef> with the same `unittype` attribute value.

Any input or other floating-point value may specify a `unit` and/or `unittype` attribute subject to guidelines clarified throughout this document.  Units and unittypes may also be provided for floatarray, vector<em>N</em> and vector<em>N</em>array quantities, with all components of the vector or all values in the array using the same unit, and for "filename"-type input, in which case the `unit` and/or `unittype` attribute applies to the float or vector<em>N</em> values read from those files.  It is not expected that all inputs will have defined units or unittypes; in fact, it is expected that the vast majority of inputs will have neither.  Units and unittypes should only be specified where specific units are important and it is reasonably expected that unit conversion may need to take place.

Please refer to the [Inputs](#inputs), [Custom Node Declaration NodeDef Elements](#custom-node-declaration-nodedef-elements), [Geometric Properties](#geometric-properties) and [Geometric Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#geometric-nodes) sections below and in the MaterialX Standard Nodes and MaterialX Geometry Extensions documents for additional specific requirements for the use of units.



## MaterialX Namespaces

MaterialX supports the specification of “namespaces”, which qualify the MaterialX names of all elements within their scope.  Namespaces are specified via a `namespace` attribute in a &lt;materialx> element, and other MaterialX files which &lt;xi:include> this .mtlx file can refer to its content without worrying about element or object naming conflicts, similar to the way namespaces are used in various programming languages.  It is permissible for multiple &lt;materialx> elements to specify the same namespace; the elements from each will simply be merged into the same namespace.  &lt;materialx> elements which do not specify a namespace will define elements into the (unnamed) global namespace.  MaterialX namespaces are most commonly used to define families of custom nodes (nodedefs), material libraries, or commonly-used network shaders or nodegraphs.

References to elements in a different namespace are qualified using the syntax "_namespace_:_elementname_", where _namespace_ is the namespace at the scope of the referenced element and _elementname_ is the name of the referenced element.  References to elements in the same namespace, or to elements in the global namespace, should not be qualified.

#### Namespace Examples

Mtllib.mtlx contains the following (assuming that "..." contains any necessary material input connections and other element definitions):

```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <materialx version="major.minor" namespace="stdmaterials">
    ...
    <surfacematerial name="wood">
      ...
    </surfacematerial>
    <surfacematerial name="plastic">
      ...
    </surfacematerial>
  </materialx>
```

Then another MaterialX file could reference these materials like this:

```xml
    <xi:include href="mtllib.mtlx"/>
    ...
    <look name="hero">
      <materialassign name="m1" material="stdmaterials:wood" collection="C_wood">
      <materialassign name="m2" material="stdmaterials:plastic" collection="C_plastic">
    </look>
```

Similarly, if a .mtlx file defining the "site_ops" namespace defined a custom color3-typed node "mynoise" with a single float input "f", it could be used in a node graph like this:

```xml
    <site_ops:mynoise name="mn1" type="color3">
      <input name="f" type="float" value="0.3"/>
    </site_ops:mynoise>
```

A `namespace` attribute may also be added to individual &lt;nodedef>s or &lt;nodegraph>s, in which case the `name` and `node` of a &lt;nodedef>, or just the `name` of a &lt;nodegraph> will be assigned to the specified `namespace`.  In a &lt;nodegraph>, the `nodedef` must include a namespace reference if the &lt;nodedef> to which it refers is defined in a specific namespace, even if it's the same namespace as the &lt;nodegraph>: this is because the `namespace` only applies to the content that is created by or contained within an element, not to anything external referenced by that element.

```xml
  <nodedef name="ND_myshader" node="myshader" namespace="mynamespace">
    <output name="surfaceshader" type="surfaceshader"/>
  </nodedef>

  <nodegraph name="NG_myshader" nodedef="mynamespace:ND_myshader"
             namespace="mynamespace">
    <standard_surface name="my_surf_shader" type="surfaceshader" >
      <input name="base_color" type="color3" value="0.264575,1.0,1.0" />
    </standard_surface>
    <output name="surfaceshader" type="surfaceshader" nodename="my_surf_shader" />
  </nodegraph>
```



## Geometric Properties

Geometric Properties, or "geomprops", are intrinsic or user-defined surface coordinate properties of geometries referenced in a specific space and/or index, and are functionally equivalent to USD's concept of "primvars".  A number of geometric properties are predefined in MaterialX: `position`, `normal`, `tangent`, `bitangent`, `texcoord` and `geomcolor`, the values of which can be accessed in nodegraphs using elements of those same names; see the [Geometric Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#geometric-nodes) section of the MaterialX Standard Nodes document for details.  The value of a varying geometric property can also be used as the default value for a node input using a `defaultgeomprop` attribute.

The following geometric properties are pre-defined by MaterialX:

| GeomProp Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Pobject | vector3 | Object space position |
| Nobject | vector3 | Object space surface normal |
| Tobject | vector3 | Object space tangent vector (index 0) |
| Bobject | vector3 | Object space bitangent vector (index 0) |
| Pworld | vector3 | World space position |
| Nworld | vector3 | World space surface normal |
| Tworld | vector3 | World space tangent vector (index 0) |
| Bworld | vector3 | World space bitangent vector (index 0) |
| UV0 | vector2 | Index "0" UV texture coordinate |

One may also define custom geometric properties using a &lt;geompropdef> element:

```xml
  <geompropdef name="geompropname" type="geomproptype" [uniform="true|false"]
        [geomprop="geomproperty"] [space="geomspace"] [index="indexnumber"]/>
```

e.g.

```xml
  <geompropdef name="Pworld" type="vector3" geomprop="position" space="world"/>
  <geompropdef name="uv1" type="vector2" geomprop="texcoord" index="1"/>
```

The `type` of the geomprop may be any non-array MaterialX type, although `string`- or `filename`-type geomprops must be declared with uniform="true".  The "geomprop", "space" and "index" attributes are optional; if "geomprop" is specified, it must be one of the standard geometric properties noted above, and if it is not specified, the new geomprop is a blind geometric property, e.g. one that can be referenced but which MaterialX knows no details about.  The "space" and "index" attributes may only be specified if a "geomprop" attribute is specified and the standard geomproperty supports it.  "Geomprop", "space" and "index" attributes may not be specified for `uniform="true"` geomprops.

Once defined, a custom geomprop name may be used any place that a standard geomprop can:

```xml
  <nodedef name="ND1" ... internalgeomprops="position, Pworld, normal, uv1">
```

A geompropdef may also specify a `unittype` and a `unit` to indicate that the geometric property is defined in terms of a specific unit.  If a geomprop with a defined unit is accessed in a nodegraph using &lt;geompropvalue>, the geometric property value will be converted from the unit specified by the geompropdef to the application-specified scene unit.

```xml
  <geompropdef name="objheight" type="float" unittype="distance" unit="meter"/>
```


## Geometric Spaces

Various operator nodes may need to specify which 3D space a position or vector is in.  The following values are supported by the `space` inputs of Geometric nodes and when transforming from one space to another:

* "model": The local coordinate space of the geometry, before any local deformations or global transforms have been applied.
* "object": The local coordinate space of the geometry, after local deformations have been applied, but before any global transforms.
* "world": The global coordinate space of the geometry, after local deformations and global transforms have been applied.



## File Prefixes

As a shorthand convenience, MaterialX allows the specification of a `fileprefix` attribute which will be prepended to input values of type "filename" (e.g. `file` inputs in `<image>` nodes, or any shader input of type "filename") specified within the scope of the element defining the `fileprefix`.  Note that `fileprefix` values are only prepended to input with a `type` attribute that explicitly states its data type as “filename”.  Since the values of the prefix and the filename are string-concatenated, the value of a `fileprefix` should generally end with a "/".  Fileprefixes are frequently used to split off common path components for asset directories, e.g. to define an asset's "texture root" directory.

So the following snippets are equivalent:

```xml
  <nodegraph name="nodegraph1">
    <image name="in1" type="color3">
      <input name="file" type="filename" value="textures/color/color1.tif"/>
    </image>
    <image name="in2" type="color3">
      <input name="file" type="filename" value="textures/color2/color2.tif"/>
    </image>
  </nodegraph>

  <nodegraph name="nodegraph1" fileprefix="textures/color/">
    <image name="in1" type="color3">
      <input name="file" type="filename" value="color1.tif"/>
    </image>
    <image name="in2" type="color3">
      <input name="file" type="filename" fileprefix="textures/"
            value="color2/color2.tif"/>
    </image>
  </nodegraph>
```

Note in the second example that `<image>` "in2" redefined `fileprefix` for itself, and that any other nodes in the same nodegraph would use the fileprefix value ("textures/color/") defined in the parent/enclosing scope.

Note: Application implementations have access to both the raw input values and attributes (e.g. the "file" name and the current "fileprefix") and to fully-resolved filenames at the scope of any given element.



## Filename Substitutions

Filename input values for various nodes can include one or more special strings, which will be replaced as described in the following table.  Substitution strings within &lt;>'s come from the current geometry, strings within []'s come from the MaterialX state, and strings within {}'s come from the host application environment.

| Token | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| &lt;UDIM> | A special geometry token that will be replaced with the computed four digit Mari-style "udim" value at render or evaluation time based on the current point’s uv value, using the formula UDIM = 1001 + U + V*10, where U is the integer portion of the u coordinate, and V is the integer portion of the v coordinate. |
| &lt;UVTILE> | A special geometry token that will be replaced with the computed Mudbox-style "u<em>U</em>_v<em>V</em>" string,  where <em>U</em> is 1+ the integer portion of the u coordinate, and <em>V</em> is 1+ the integer portion of the v coordinate. |
| [<em>interface token</em>] | The value of a specified token declared in the containing nodegraph's &lt;nodedef> interface; the value for the token may be set in the shader node in a material referencing the node or within a &lt;variant>; it is an error if the same token is defined in more than one of those places for the current geometry. |
| {<em>hostattr</em>} | The host application may define other variables which can be resolved within filenames. |
| {frame} | A special string that will be replaced by the current frame number, as defined by the host environment. |
| {0<em>N</em>frame} | A special string that will be replaced by the current frame number padded with zeros to be <em>N</em> digits total (replace <em>N</em> with a number): e.g. {04frame} will be replaced by a 4-digit zero-padded frame number such as "0010". |


Note: Implementations are expected to retain substitution strings within filenames upon export rather than "baking them out" into fully-evaluated filenames.  Applications using USD for geometry and assignments may additionally use a &lt;_geometry token_> (a.k.a. "&lt;_primvarname_>") as the entire filename string to access an entire string primvar value unchanged (though that string value may contain the USD-supported &lt;UDIM> token).

# Nodes

Nodes are individual data generation or processing "blocks".  Node functionality can range from simple operations such as returning a constant color value or adding two input values, to more complex image processing operations, 3D spatial data operations, or even complete shader BxDFs.  Nodes are connected together into a network or "node graph", and pass typed data streams between them.

Individual node elements have the form:

```xml
  <nodecategory name="nodename" type="outputdatatype" [version="version"]
               [nodedef="nodedef_name"]>
    <input name="inputname" type="type" [nodename="nodename"] [value="value"]/>
    ...additional input or token elements...
  </nodecategory>
```

where _nodecategory_ is the general "category" of the node (e.g. "image", "add" or "mix"), `name` (string, required) defines the name of this instance of the node, which must be unique within the scope it appears in, and `type` (string, required) specifies the MaterialX type (typically float, color<em>N</em>, or vector<em>N</em>) of the output of that node.  If the application uses a different name for this instance of the node in the user interface, a `uiname` attribute may be added to the &lt;_nodecategory_> element to indicate the name of the node as it appears to the user.

Node elements may optionally specify a `version` string attribute in "_major_[._minor_]" format, requesting that a specific version of that node's definition be used instead of the default version.  Normally, the types of a node's inputs and outputs are sufficient to disambiguate which signature of the applicable version of a node is intended, but if necessary, a node instantiation may also declare a specific nodedef name to precisely define exactly which node signature is desired.  Please refer to the [Custom Node Declaration NodeDef Elements](#custom-node-declaration-nodedef-elements) section below for further details.

MaterialX defines a number of [Standard Nodes](#standard-nodes) which all implementations should support as described to the degree their architecture and capabilities allow.  One can define new nodes by declaring their parameter interfaces and providing portable nodegraph or target-specific shading language implementations.  Please see the [Custom Nodes](#custom-nodes) section for notes and implementation details.



## Inputs

Node elements contain zero or more &lt;input> elements defining the name, type, and value or connection for each node input.  Input elements can assign an explicit uniform value by providing a `value` attribute, make a connection to the output of another node by providing a `nodename` attribute, or make a connection to the output of a nodegraph by providing a `nodegraph` attribute.  An optional `output` attribute may also be provided for &lt;input> elements, allowing the input to connect to a specific, named output of the referenced upstream node or nodegraph.  If the referenced node/nodegraph has multiple outputs, `output` is required; if it has only one output, the `output` attribute of the &lt;input> is ignored.  Input elements may be defined to only accept uniform values, in which case the input may provide a `value` or a `nodename` connection to the output of a [&lt;constant> node](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#node-constant) (possibly through one or more no-op [&lt;dot> nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#node-dot)) or any other node whose output is explicitly declared to be "uniform", but may not provide a `nodename` or `nodegraph` connection to any arbitrary node output or to any nodegraph output.  String- and filename-type inputs are required to be "uniform", as are any array-typed inputs.  Input elements may be connected to an external parameter interface in the node definition, allowing them to be assigned values from materials or node instantiations; this includes "uniform" and string/filename-type inputs, however, the same connectability restrictions listed above apply to the inputs of the material or node instance.  Inputs may only be connected to node/nodegraph outputs or nodedef interface inputs of the same type, though it is permissible for a `string`-type output to be connected to a `filename`-type input (but not the other way around).

A float/vector<em>N</em> input of a node, or a "filename"-type input referring to an image file containing float or vector<em>N</em> values, may specify a unit for its value by providing a `unit` attribute, and that unit must be one associated with the `unittype` for that input in the nodedef, if specified; please see the [Units](#units) section above for details on declaring units and unittypes.  If the nodedef for a node (see the [Custom Nodes](#custom-nodes) section below) does not declare a `unittype` for an input, the node may do so; it is not permissible to provide a `unit` for a node input without a compatible `unittype` being defined on either the node or applicable nodedef.

```xml
  <constant name="boxwidth" type="float">
    <input name="value" type="float" value="2.39" unittype="distance" unit="foot"/>
  </constant>
```

Unless specified otherwise, all inputs default to a value of 0 in all channels for integer, float, color and vector types, "" for string and filename types, "false" for boolean types, the identity matrix for matrix types, and for array types, an appropriate-length array consisting of the default value for the array's base type.

Standard MaterialX nodes have exactly one output, while custom nodes may have any number of outputs; please see the [Custom Nodes](#custom-nodes) section for details.



## Node Graph Elements

A graph containing any number of nodes and output declarations forms a Node Graph, which may be enclosed within a &lt;nodegraph> element to group them together into a single functional unit.  Please see the [Custom Node Definition Using Node Graphs](#custom-node-definition-using-node-graphs) section below for details on how nodegraphs can be used to describe the functionality of new nodes.

```xml
  <nodegraph name="graphname">
    ...node element(s)...
    ...output element(s)...
  </nodegraph>
```



## Output Elements

Output data streams are defined using **&lt;output>** elements, and may be used to declare which output streams are connectable to other MaterialX elements.  Within a node graph, an &lt;output> element declares an output stream that may be connected to a shader input or to the input of a referencing node in another graph when the nodegraph is the implementation of a custom node.  See the [Custom Node Definition Using Node Graphs](#custom-node-definition-using-node-graphs) section for details on the use of node graphs as node implementations.

```xml
  <output name="albedo" type="color3" nodename="n9"/>
  <output name="precomp" type="color4" nodename="n13" width="1024" height="512"
          bitdepth="16"/>
```

Attributes for Output elements:

* `name` (string, required): the name of the output
* `type` (string, required): the MaterialX type of the output
* `nodename` (string, optional): the name of a node at the same scope within the document, whose result value will be output.  This attribute is required for &lt;output> elements within a node graph, but is not allowed in &lt;output> elements within a &lt;nodedef>.
* `output` (string, optional): if the node specified by `nodename` has multiple outputs, the name of the specific output to connect this &lt;output> to.
* `uniform` (boolean, optional): If set to "true", then the output of this node is treated as a uniform value, and this output may be connected to a uniform input of the same (or compatible) type.  It is up to the application creating the nodegraph to ensure that the value actually is uniform.  Default is "false".

MaterialX also supports the following additional attributes for Output elements in applications which process node graphs in 2D space and save or cache outputs as images for efficiency, such as texture baking or image caching.  These attributes do **not** affect values from this &lt;output> connected to other nodes, e.g. they would remain in the working colorspace and retain full resolution and bitdepth precision.

* `colorspace` (string, optional): the name of the color space for the output image.  Applications that support color space management are expected to perform the required transformations of output colors into this space.
* `width` (integer, optional): the expected width in pixels of the output image.
* `height` (integer, optional): the expected height in pixels of the output image.
* `bitdepth` (integer, optional): the expected per-channel bit depth of the output image, which may be used to capture expected color quantization effects.  Common values for `bitdepth` are 8, 16, 32, and 64.  It is up to the application to determine what the internal representation of any declared bit depth is (e.g. scaling factor, signed or unsigned, etc.).



## Standard Nodes

A core part of MaterialX is its set of Standard Nodes, divided into five categories: Source nodes, Operator nodes, Standard Shader nodes, Physically-Based Shading nodes, and NPR (non-photorealistic) Shading nodes.

[**Source nodes**](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#standard-source-nodes) use external data and/or procedural functions to form an output; they do not have any required inputs.  Standard Source Nodes are grouped into the following classifications: [Texture Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#texture-nodes), [Procedural Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#procedural-nodes), [Noise Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#noise-nodes), [Shape Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#shape-nodes), [Geometric Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#geometric-nodes) and [Application Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#application-nodes).

[**Operator nodes**](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#standard-operator-nodes) process one or more input streams to form an output.  Standard Operator Nodes are grouped into the following classifications: [Math Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#math-nodes), [Logical Operator Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#logical-operator-nodes), [Adjustment Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#adjustment-nodes), [Compositing Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#compositing-nodes), [Conditional Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#conditional-nodes), [Channel Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#channel-nodes) and [Convolution Nodes](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#convolution-nodes).

[**Standard Shader nodes**](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#standard-shader-nodes) comprise non-shading shaders such as for displacement, and shaders which do not respond to external illumination.

[**Physically-Based Shading nodes**](./MaterialX.PBRSpec.md) are shader-semantic nodes implementing a number of widely-used [BSDF/BSSRDF](./MaterialX.PBRSpec.md#bsdf-nodes), [emission](./MaterialX.PBRSpec.md#edf-nodes) and [volume](./MaterialX.PBRSpec.md#vdf-nodes) distribution functions and [utility nodes](./MaterialX.PBRSpec.md#utility-nodes) useful in constructing complex layered rendering shaders using node graphs, as well as a set of complete [PBR Shader Nodes](./MaterialX.PBRSpec.md#pbr-shader-nodes) implementing open standard shading models.

[**NPR Shading nodes**](./MaterialX.NPRSpec.md) are operations that are desirable in non-photorealistic shading styles but which cannot be implemented within certain rendering constructs.  These include [NPR Application Nodes](./MaterialX.NPRSpec.md#npr-application-nodes), [NPR Utility Nodes](./MaterialX.NPRSpec.md#npr-utility-nodes) and [NPR Shading Nodes](./MaterialX.NPRSpec.md#npr-shading-nodes).



## Standard Node Inputs

All standard nodes which define a `defaultinput` or `default` value support the following input:

<a id="nodeinput-disable"> </a>

* `disable` (uniform boolean): if set to true, the node will pass its default input or value to its output, effectively disabling the node; default is false.  Applications may choose to implement the `disable` input by skipping over the disabled node during traversal and instead passing through a connection to the defaultinput node or outputting the node's default value, rather than using an actual `disable` input in the node implementation.


## Standard UI Attributes

All elements support the following additional UI-related attributes:

<a id="attr-doc"> </a>

* `doc` (string attribute): a description of the function or purpose of this element; may include standard HTML formatting strings such as &lt;b>, &lt;ul>, &lt;p>, etc. but no complex formatting such as CSS or external references (e.g. no hyperlinks or images).  May be used for functional documentation, or for UI pop-up "tool tip" strings.


All node types (sources, operators, shader nodes and material nodes) as well as &lt;look> elements support the following UI-related attributes:

<a id="attr-xpos"> </a>

* `xpos` (float attribute): X-position of the upper-left corner of the node when drawn in a UI.

<a id="attr-ypos"> </a>

* `ypos` (float attribute): Y-position of the upper-left corner of the node when drawn in a UI.

<a id="attr-width"> </a>

* `width` (float attribute): the relative width of the node when drawn in a UI; default is 1.0.

<a id="attr-height"> </a>

* `height` (float attribute): the relative height of the node when drawn in a UI; default is 1.0.

<a id="attr-uicolor"> </a>

* `uicolor` (color3 attribute): the display-referred color of the node as drawn in the UI, normalized to 0.0-1.0 range; default is to not specify a particular color so the application's default node color would be used.  `uicolor` values are expressed as color3 values in "none" colorspace, and thus are not affected by the current `colorspace`.

All positioning and sizing attribute values are specified relative to an application's default size for drawing a node including any minimal-length connection edges and arrows.  So a node drawn at position (xpos, ypos) will "look good" if connected to nodes drawn at position (xpos+width, ypos) and at position (xpos, ypos+height), and a node specifying `width="2"` would be drawn twice as wide (including outside whitespace for a minimal connecting arrow) as a node with the default width.  It is not necessary that nodes be placed exactly on integer grid boundaries; this merely states the scale of nodes. It is also not assumed that the pixel scaling factors for X and Y are the same: the actual UI unit "grid" does not have to be square.  If xpos and ypos are not both specified, placement of the node when drawn in a UI is undefined, and it is up to the application to figure out placement (which could mean "all piled up in the center in a tangled mess").

MaterialX defines xpos values to be increasing left to right, ypos values to be increasing top to bottom, and the general flow is generally downward.  E.g. node inputs are on the top and outputs on the bottom, and a node at (10, 10) could connect naturally to a node at (10, 11).  Content creation applications using left-to-right flow can simply exchange X and Y coordinates in their internal representations when reading or writing MaterialX data, and applications that internally use Y coordinates increasing upward rather than downward can invert the Y coordinates between MTLX files and their internal representations.

The &lt;input> and &lt;token> elements within &lt;nodedef>s and node instantiations (but not within &lt;implementation>s or &lt;nodegraph> parameter interfaces) support the following UI-related attributes:

<a id="attr-uivisible"> </a>

* `uivisible` (boolean attribute): whether or not the input is visible in the UI.  If `uivisible` is specified on an input/token in a &lt;nodedef> that defines the default visibility of that input/token, while a `uivisible` specified on a input/token in a node instantiation affects just the visibility of the input/token within that particular instantiation.  Default is "true".

<a id="attr-uiadvanced"> </a>

* `uiadvanced` (boolean attribute): whether or not the input is considered to be an "advanced" parameter which an application may choose to hide in a more "basic" mode.  Should normally be declared only within a &lt;nodedef>.  Default is "false", meaning the input should be displayed if `uivisible` is true, while "true" means the input would be displayed if `uivisible` is true and the application UI is set to show "advanced" parameters.



## Backdrop Elements

Backdrop elements are used to contain, group, and document nodes within a node graph, and they have no impact on the functionality of the graph.  The following attributes are supported by &lt;backdrop> elements:

* `contains` (stringarray attribute): a comma-separated list of node names that the backdrop "contains"; default is to contain no nodes.
* `minimized` (boolean attribute): whether or not this backdrop is collapsed to a single node-sized box in the application's UI or not; default is false.

Backdrop elements also support the standard `width`, `height`, `xpos`, `ypos` and `doc` attributes.




## Node Graph Examples

The following examples demonstrate how a MaterialX Document might encode graphs of nodes.


#### Nodegraph Example 1

A simple merge of two single-layer images with a separate mask image, followed by a simple color operation.

![Nodegraph Example 1](media/nodegraph1.png "Nodegraph Example 1")

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<materialx>
  <image name="img1" type="color3">
    <input name="file" type="filename" value="layer1.tif"/>
  </image>
  <image name="img2" type="color3">
    <input name="file" type="filename" value="layer2.tif"/>
  </image>
  <image name="img3" type="float">
    <input name="file" type="filename" value="mask1.tif"/>
  </image>
  <mix name="n0" type="color3">
    <input name="fg" type="color3" nodename="img1"/>
    <input name="bg" type="color3" nodename="img2"/>
    <input name="mix" type="float" nodename="img3"/>
  </mix>
  <multiply name="n1" type="color3">
    <input name="in1" type="color3" nodename="n0"/>
    <input name="in2" type="float" value="0.22"/>
  </multiply>
  <output name="diffuse" type="color3" nodename="n1"/>
</materialx>
```


#### Nodegraph Example 2

A more complex nodegraph using geometry properties to define two diffuse albedo colors and two masks, then color-correcting one albedo less red and more blue and increasing the contrast of the other, blending the two through an area mask, and adding a small amount of scaled 2D Perlin noise within a second mask.  The graph outputs the area mask layer separately from the composited diffuse albedo color.

# Customization, Targeting and Shading

While the Standard Nodes are considered universal across all MaterialX applications, there are many circumstances in which one would like to extend this with new custom functionality, or define functionality or underlying implementations specific to different applications or renderers.  This includes the definition of nodes for shading and materials.


## Target Definition

MaterialX supports the definition of nodes, attributes and inputs that are specific to particular rendering "targets".  This allows a single implementation to restrict certain values or nodes to only the targets for which they are valid, or to allow separate definitions of the same node functionality for different renderers.

Targets are declared using a &lt;targetdef> element:

```xml
  <targetdef name="oslpattern"/>
  <targetdef name="glsl"/>
  <targetdef name="mdl"/>
```

A target may inherit from another target, so that any reference to a parent target will automatically include any definitions specific to the inherited child target that do not have a definition for the parent target itself:

```xml
  <targetdef name="osl" inherit="oslpattern"/>
  <targetdef name="vrayglsl" inherit="glsl"/>
  <targetdef name="vrayosl" inherit="oslpattern"/>
```

In the above example, any renderer that requests nodes/inputs/attributes for the "osl" target will also see any node/input/attribute that is defined with `target="oslpattern"`.  A renderer may also declare that it will accept implementations for multiple targets, e.g. Vray might declare it will accept either "vrayosl", "mdl" or "vrayglsl", with "vrayosl" preferred.

A targetdef element may also specify additional custom attributes for that target, such as configuration or code generation options.


## Custom Attributes and Inputs

#### Custom Attributes

While the MaterialX specification describes the attributes and elements that are meaningful to MaterialX-compliant applications, it is permissible to add custom attributes and inputs to standard MaterialX elements.  These custom attributes and child elements are ignored by applications that do not understand them, although applications should preserve and re-output them with their values and connections even if they do not understand their meaning.

If an application requires additional information related to any MaterialX element, it may define and utilize additional attributes with non-standard names.  Custom attributes are defined using &lt;attributedef> elements:


```xml
  <attributedef name="name" attrname="attrname" type="type" value="defaultvalue"
               [target="targets"] [elements="elements"] [exportable="true"]/>
```

where _name_ is a unique name for the attributedef, _attrname_ is the name of the custom attribute to define, _type_ is the type of the attribute (typically string, stringarray, integer or boolean, although any MaterialX type is allowed), _defaultvalue_ is the default value for the attribute, _target_ is an optional list of targets to which this attribute applies, and _elements_ is an optional list of element names or elementname/inputname in which the attribute may be used.  It is also permissible to provide enum and enumvalues attributes for an attributedef, to define specific labels and values that the custom attribute is allowed to take, using the same syntax and limitations as enum/enumvalues on nodedef inputs and tokens (see below).  By default, a custom attribute is not emitted as metadata in generated shaders, but can be exported if the `exportable` attribute is set to "true".  Examples:

```xml
  <attributedef name="AD_maxmtlname" attrname="maxmtlname" type="string" value=""
                target="3dsmax" elements="surfacematerial"/>
  <attributedef name="AD_updir" attrname="updir" type="integer" value="1"
                enum="Yup,Zup" enumvalues="1,2"/>
  <attributedef name="AD_img_vflip" attrname="vflip" type="boolean" value="false"
                target="mystudio" elements="image/file"/>
```

The first example above defines a 3ds Max-specific name attribute for surface materials, which may be given a value in addition to its MaterialX-compliant name in order to preserve the original package-specific name; it is assumed here that `maxmtlname` is the attribute name used by that particular implementation for this purpose.  The second example defines a "mystudio"-specific boolean attribute "vflip", which could be used in the "file" input of &lt;image> nodes.

Once defined, custom attributes may be used in exactly the same manner as standard attributes:

```xml
  <surfacematerial name="sssmarble" maxmtlname="SSS Marble">
    <input name="surfaceshader" node="marblesrf"/>
  </surfacematerial>
  <image name="im1" type="color3">
    <input name="file" type="filename" value="X.tif" vflip="true"/>
    ...
  </image>
```


#### Custom Inputs

If an application requires additional custom inputs within a standard MaterialX node, it may define a target application-specific &lt;nodedef> for that node inheriting the base input definitions from the standard node's &lt;nodedef>, then add inputs specific to that target application.  

```xml
  <nodedef name="ND_image_color4_maya" node="image" target="maya" inherit="ND_image_color4">
    <input name="preFilter" type="boolean" value="true"/>
  </nodedef>
```

In the above example, a Maya-specific version of the color4-type &lt;image> node has been declared, inheriting from the standard declaration then adding a maya-specific "preFilter" input.

When using a node, the definition appropriate for the current target will automatically be used, and other targets will ignore any inputs that are not part of the nodedef for that target.  However, one may specify a documentational  `target` attribute on an input to hint what target it is intended for if desired.  In this example, the "preFilter" input has indicated that it is specific to the "maya" target.

```xml
  <image name="image1" type="color4">
    <input name="file" type="filename" value="image1.tif"/>
    <input name="preFilter" type="boolean" value="true" target="maya"/>
  </image>
```


## Custom Nodes

Specific applications will commonly support sources and operators that do not map directly to standard MaterialX nodes.  Individual implementations may provide their own custom nodes, with &lt;nodedef> elements to declare their parameter interfaces, and &lt;implementation> and/or &lt;nodegraph> elements to define their behaviors.


### Custom Node Declaration NodeDef Elements

Each custom node must be explicitly declared with a &lt;nodedef> element, with child &lt;input>, &lt;token> and &lt;output> elements specifying the expected names and types of the node’s inputs and output(s).

Attributes for &lt;nodedef> elements:

* `name` (string, required): a unique name for this &lt;nodedef>
* `node` (string, required): the name of the custom node being defined
* `inherit` (string, optional): the `name` of a &lt;nodedef> to inherit node definitions from; the output types of this nodedef and the inherited one must match, and the input/output definitions of this nodedef will be applied on top of those in the inherited-from one.
* `nodegroup` (string, optional): an optional group to which this node declaration belongs.  Standard MaterialX nodes have `nodegroup` values matching the titles of the section headings in which they are described, e.g. "texture2d", "procedural", "geometric", "application", "math", "adjustment", "compositing", "conditional", "channel", "convolution", or "organization".
* `version` (string, optional): a version string for this nodedef, allowing usage of a node to reference a specific version of a node.  Version strings should be of the format "_major_[._minor_]", i.e. one or two integer numbers separated by a dot (the minor version is assumed to be "0" if not provided).  If there are multiple nodedefs for the same `node` and `target` with the same combination of input and output types, they must each specify a `version`.
* `isdefaultversion` (boolean, optional): If true, then this nodedef should be used for node instances which do not request a specific version.  Specifying `isdefaultversion` "true" is only required if there are multiple nodedefs for a node declaring a `version`, and it is not permissible for multiple nodedefs for the same `node` and `target` with the same combination of input and output types to set `isdefaultversion` "true".  Defaults to "false".
* `target` (stringarray, optional): the set of targets to which this nodedef is restricted.  By default, a nodedef is considered universal, not restricted to any specific targets, but it is possible that certain targets may have different parameter names or usage for the same node.
* `uiname` (string, optional): an alternative "node" value for this nodedef to be displayed in the UI.  If `uiname` is not provided, then `node` is the presumed UI node value for the nodedef.  This is most useful when the &lt;nodedef> defines a namespace, so the user doesn't need to see a full namespaced path for the node.
* `internalgeomprops` (stringarray, optional): a list of MaterialX geometric properties (e.g. "position", "normal", "texcoord", etc. or any name defined by a &lt;geompropdef> element) that the node expects to be able to access internally.  This metadata hint allows code generators to ensure this data is available and can be used for error checking.  `Internalgeomprops` is most useful for nodes whose implementation is defined by external code; it is not necessary for nodegraph-defined nodes, as the list of geometric properties accessed can be determined by examining the nodegraph.

Custom nodes are allowed to overload a single `node` name by providing multiple &lt;nodedef> elements with different combinations of input and output types.  This overloading is permitted both for custom `node` names and for the standard MaterialX node set.  Within the scope of a single MaterialX document and its included content, no two &lt;nodedef> elements with an identical combination of input and output types for the same target and version may be provided for a single `node` name.  It is recommended that all &lt;nodedef> variations for a `node` use exactly the same set of input names differing only in their types, with no variation adding or removing any inputs.  It is also recommended that newer versions of nodes be fully backward-compatible with earlier versions (including default values of input) so that a change in default version of a node does not break functionality; if this is not possible, using a different `node` name is recommended.

The `inherit` attribute may be provided to allow one &lt;nodedef> to inherit from another: this is most useful for defining additional inputs in a target- or version-specific &lt;nodedef>, inheriting from a generic, canonical definition of a node or shader.  NodeDefs which inherit from another nodedef may not re-declare &lt;output>s from the parent nodedef, only add additional new &lt;output>s.

NodeDefs must define one or more child &lt;output> elements within the &lt;nodedef> to state the name and type of each output; for nodes defined using a nodegraph, the names and types of the outputs must agree with the &lt;output> elements in the nodegraph.  The output name for a single-output &lt;nodedef> is less important, as any connection made to the output of a single-output node will succeed regardless of the actual `name` referenced, although by convention, the name "out" is preferred for single-output nodes.  See the [**NodeDef Output Elements**](#nodedef-output-elements) section below for details.


#### NodeDef Parameter Interface

The parameter interface of a custom node is specified via a set of child &lt;input> and &lt;token> elements of the &lt;nodedef>, while documentation of the folder structure of a node may be defined using a number of &lt;uifolder> elements, each of which may provide a doc attribute to provide documentation for that folder layer.  A &lt;uifolder> element may not contain any other elements; in particular, the &lt;input>s and &lt;token>s of the nodedef interface must be direct children of the &lt;nodedef>.  Nested folders may be indicated using a full path for the folder, with a "/" separator between folder levels.

```xml
  <nodedef name="ND_multinoise" node="multinoise">
    <uifolder name="ui_noise" uifolder="Noise" doc="Noise Controls">
    <uifolder name="ui_noiselarge" uifolder="Noise/Large" doc="Large Scale Noise">
    <uifolder name="ui_noisefine" uifolder="Noise/Fine" doc="Fine Scale Noise">
    ...input and token definitions...
  </nodedef>
```


#### NodeDef Input Elements

**Input** elements are used within a &lt;nodedef> to declare the spatially-varying and uniform inputs for a node:

```xml
  <input name="inputname" type="inputtype" [value="value"]/>
```

Attributes for NodeDef Input elements:

* `name` (string, required): the name of the shader input
* `type` (string, required): the MaterialX type of the shader input
* `value` (same type as `type`, optional): a default value for this input, to be used if the input remains unconnected and is not otherwise assigned a value
* `uniform` (boolean, optional): if set to "true", then this input can only take uniform values and may only be connected to the outputs of &lt;constant> nodes or any other node whose output is explicitly declared to be "uniform" (optionally through a number of &lt;dot> nodes), but not to the outputs of other (non-"uniform") nodes.  `uniform` must be set to true for string and filename-type inputs.
* `defaultgeomprop` (string, optional): for vector2 or vector3 inputs, the name of an intrinsic geometric property that provides the default value for this input, must be one of "position", "normal", "tangent", "bitangent" or "texcoord" or vector3-type custom geometric property for vector3 inputs, or "texcoord" or vector2-type custom geometric property for vector2 inputs.  For standard geometric properties, this is effectively the same as declaring a default connection of the input to a Geometric Node with default input values.  May not be specified on uniform inputs.
* `enum` (stringarray, optional): a comma-separated non-exclusive list of string value descriptors that the input couldmayis allowed to take: for string- and stringarray-type inputs, these are the actual values (or values per array index for stringarrays); for other types, these are the "enum" labels e.g. as shown in the application user interface for each of the actual underlying values specified by `enumvalues`.  The enum list can be thought of as a list of commonly used values or UI labels for the input rather than a strict list, and MaterialX itself does not enforce that a specified input enum value is actually in this list, with the exception that if the input is a "string" (or "stringarray") type and an enum list is provided, then the value(s) must in fact be one of the enum stringarray values.
* `enumvalues` (<em>type</em>array, optional): for non-string/stringarray types, a comma-separated list of values of the same base type as the &lt;input>, representing the values that would be used if the corresponding `enum` string was chosen in the UI.  MaterialX itself does not enforce that a specified input value is actually in this list.  Note that implementations are allowed to redefine `enumvalues` (but not `enum`) for specific targets: see the [Custom Node Definition Using Implementation Elements](#custom-node-definition-using-implementation-elements) section below.
* `colorspace` (string, optional): for color3- or color4-type inputs, the colorspace of the default value for this input.
* `unittype` (string, optional): the type of unit for this input, e.g. "distance", which must be defined by a &lt;unittypedef>.  Default is to not specify a unittype.  Only float-, vector<em>N</em>- and filename-type inputs may specify a `unittype`.
* `unit` (string, optional): the specific unit for this input.  Nodedef inputs do not typically specify a unit; if it does, that would indicate that the implementation of that node expects values to be specified in that unit, and that any invocation of that node using a different unit should be converted to the nodedef-specified unit for that input rather than to the application's scene unit.  The most common instance of this is for angular values, where a nodedef might specify that it expects values to be given in degrees.
* `uiname` (string, optional): an alternative name for this input as it appears in the UI.  If `uiname` is not provided, then `name` is the presumed UI name for the input.
* `uifolder` (attribute, string, optional): the pathed name of the folder in which this input appears in the UI, using a "/" character as a separator for nested UI folders.
* `uimin` (integer or float or color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, optional): for inputs of type integer, float, color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, the minimum value that the UI allows for this particular value.  MaterialX itself does not enforce this as an actual minimum value.
* `uimax` (integer or float or color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, optional): for inputs of type integer, float, color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, the maximum value that the UI allows for this particular value.  MaterialX itself does not enforce this as an actual maximum value.
* `uisoftmin` (integer or float or color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, optional): for inputs of type integer, float, color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, a suggested minimum UI slider value for this input, should be >= `uimin`.  MaterialX itself does not enforce this as an actual minimum value.
* `uisoftmax` (integer or float or color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, optional): for inputs of type integer, float, color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, a suggested maximum UI slider value for this inputs, should be &lt;= `uimax`.  MaterialX itself does not enforce this as an actual maximum value.
* `uistep` (integer or float or color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, optional): for inputs of type integer, float, color<em>N</em> or vector<em>N</em>, the increment size that the UI would increment or decrement a component of the input value.
* `hint` (string): A hint to help code generators understand how the input may be used.  The following hints for nodedef inputs are currently defined:
    * "transparency": the input is indicating a level of shading transparency.
    * "opacity": the input is indicating a level of shading opacity (inverse of transparency).
    * "anisotropy": the presence of this hint on an input indicates that anisotropic reflections _may_ (but not necessarily) be taking place; if no input on a shading node(def) defines an "anisotropic" hint, then some implementations may use this as an optimization to allow only isotropic reflections.

It is permissible to define a `value` or a `defaultgeomprop` for an input but not both.  If neither `value` or `defaultgeomprop` are defined, then the input becomes required, and any invocation of the custom node without providing a value or connection for this input would be in error.


#### NodeDef Token Elements

**Token** elements are used within a &lt;nodedef> to declare uniform "interface token" string-substitution values to be referenced and substituted within filenames used in a node's nodegraph implementation:

```xml
  <token name="tokenname" type="tokentype" [value="value"]/>
```

Attributes for NodeDef Token elements:

* `name` (string, required): the name of the token
* `type` (string, required): the MaterialX type of the token; when the token's value is substituted into a filename, the token value will be cast to a string, so string or integer types are recommended for tokens, although any MaterialX type is permitted.
* `value` (same type as `type`, optional): a default value for this token, to be used if the node is invoked without a value defined for this token.  If a default value is not defined, then the token becomes required, so any invocation of the custom node without a value assigned to that token would be in error.
* `enum` (stringarray, optional): a comma-separated non-exclusive list of string value descriptors that the token could take: for string-type tokens, these are the actual values; for other types, these are the "enum" labels e.g. as shown in the application user interface for each of the actual underlying values specified by enumvalues.  The enum list can be thought of as a list of commonly used values or UI labels for the input rather than a strict list, and MaterialX itself does not enforce that a specified token enum value is actually in this list, with the exception that if the input is a "string" (or "stringarray") type and an enum list is provided, then the value(s) must in fact be one of the enum stringarray values.
* `enumvalues` (<em>type</em>array, optional): for non-string types, a comma-separated list of values of the same base type as the &lt;token>, representing the values that would be used if the corresponding enum string was chosen in the UI.  MaterialX itself does not enforce that a specified token value is actually in this list.  Note that implementations are allowed to redefine enumvalues (but not enum) for specific targets: see the [Custom Node Definition Using Implementation Elements](#custom-node-definition-using-implementation-elements) section below.
* `uiname` (string, optional): an alternative name for this token as it appears in the UI.  If `uiname` is not provided, then `name` is the presumed UI name for the token.
* `uifolder` (string, optional): the pathed name of the folder in which this token appears in the UI, using a "/" character as a separator for nested UI folders.

Please see the [Example Pre-Shader Compositing Material](#example-pre-shader-compositing-material) in the [Material Nodes](#material-nodes) section below for an example of how Tokens are used.


#### NodeDef Output Elements

**Output** elements are used within a &lt;nodedef> to declare an output for node definitions, including the output's name, type, and default value or "defaultinput" connection:

```xml
  <output name="outputname" type="outputtype" [value="value"]/>
```

Attributes for NodeDef Output elements:

* `name` (string, required): the name of the output.  For nodes with a single output, the name "out" is preferred.
* `type` (string, required): the MaterialX type of the output.
* `defaultinput` (string, optional): the name of an &lt;input> element within the &lt;nodedef>, which must be the same type as `type`, that will be passed through unmodified by applications that don’t have an implementation for this node.
* `default` (same type as `type`, optional): a constant value which will be output by applications that don’t have an implementation for this node, or if a `defaultinput` input is specified but that input is not connected.

The &lt;output> elements for NodeDefs are similar to those for NodeGraph outputs, except that they may define default output values for the node but may not define a connection to another node (except for the `defaultinput` pass-through connection declaration) or any output file-related attributes such as width, height, colorspace or bitdepth.



### Custom Node Definition Using Implementation Elements

Once the parameter interface of a custom node has been declared through a &lt;nodedef>, MaterialX provides two methods for precisely defining its functionality: via an &lt;implementation> element that references external source code, or via a &lt;nodegraph> element that composes the required functionality from existing nodes.  Providing a definition for a custom node is optional in MaterialX, but is recommended for maximum clarity and portability.

**Implementation** elements are used to associate external function source code with a specific nodedef.  Implementation elements support the following attributes:

* `name` (string, required): a unique name for this &lt;implementation>
* `nodedef` (string, required): the name of the &lt;nodedef> for which this &lt;implementation> applies
* `nodegraph` (string, optional): the name of the &lt;nodegraph> which is the implementation for the specified nodedef; see the [Custom Node Definition Using Node Graphs](#custom-node-definition-using-node-graphs) section below.
* `implname` (string, optional): an alternative name for this node for the specified target; this allows one to say that for this particular target, the node/shader is called something else but is functionally equivalent to the node described by the nodedef.  Note that node graphs in MaterialX documents should always use the node names defined in the nodedefs, never implementation-specific names.
* `file` (filename, optional): the URI of an external file containing the source code for the entry point of this particular node template.  This file may contain source code for other templates of the same custom node, and/or for other custom nodes.
* `sourcecode` (string, optional): a string containing the actual source code for the node.
* `function` (string, optional): the name of a function within the given source code that contains the implementation of this node.  If this attribute is not given it is assumed the source code is an inline expression for a shader code generator like ShaderGen. Please refer to appropriate language specifications and developer guides (such as the ShaderGeneration.md file in the GitHub documents/DeveloperGuide directory) for valid syntax for using inline code.
* `target` (stringarray, optional): the set of targets to which this implementation is restricted.  By default, an implementation is considered applicable to all targets that the referenced nodedef applies to.  If the referenced &lt;nodedef> also specifies a target, then this `target` must be a subset of the nodedef's target list.
* `format` (string, optional): the format used by the given source code, typically "shader" if the source code is a complete shader that can be compiled and executed as is by a target renderer, or "fragment" if the source code is a code fragment that requires processing of a code generator before it can be compiled and executed.  Default is "shader".

An &lt;implementation> may define a `file` or `sourcecode` attribute, or neither, but not both.  If an &lt;implementation> element specifies a `target` with no `file` or `sourcecode`, then it is interpreted purely as documentation that a private definition exists for the given target.  Because the definition in an &lt;implementation> may be restricted to specific targets, a &lt;nodedef> that is defined with such restrictions may not be available in all applications; for this reason, a &lt;nodedef> that is defined through an &lt;implementation> is expected to provide a value for `default` and/or `defaultinput` when possible, specifying the expected behavior when no definition for the given node can be found.  It should be noted that specifying `target` is intended to help applications differentiate between different implementations of nodes and implies compatibility for specific situations, but does not necessarily guarantee compatibility: they are intended to be hints about the particular implementation, and it is up to the host application to determine which &lt;implementation>, if any, is appropriate for any particular use.

Because the names used for node inputs (such as "normal" or "default") may conflict with the reserved words in various shading languages, or may simply be different for specific targets, &lt;implementation> elements may contain a number of &lt;input> elements to remap the `name`s of &lt;input>s as specified in the &lt;nodedef> to different `implname`s to indicate what the input name is actually called in the implementation's code.  Only the inputs that need to be remapped to new `implname`s need to be listed; for each, it is recommended that the `type` of that input be listed for clarity, but if specified, it must match the type specified in the &lt;nodedef>: &lt;implementation>s are not allowed to change the type or any other attribute defined in the &lt;nodedef>.  In this example, the &lt;implementation> declares that the "default" input defined in the "ND_image_color3" nodedef is actually called "default_value" in the "mx_image_color" function:

```xml
  <implementation name="IM_image_color3_osl" nodedef="ND_image_color3"
      file="mx_image_color.osl" function="mx_image_color" target="oslpattern">
    <input name="default" type="color3" implname="default_value"/>
  </implementation>
```

For uniform inputs and tokens whose nodedef description includes an enum list of allowable values, individual implementations may associate different target-specific resolved values for them potentially of a different type; these may be described by providing an `enumvalues` attribute on the uniform input or token within an &lt;implementation> and if appropriate, an `impltype` to declare the target-specific type of these enumvalues.  Note that if the type of an enum input in the nodedef is an array type, then the `impltype` (if specified) must also be an array type, while `enumvalues` is a list of values of the base (non-array) type.  The following &lt;implementation> states that for the "mystudio" target, the uaddressmode and vaddressmode inputs of the "image" node are actually called "extrapolate_u" and "extrapolate_v", are integers rather than strings, and take different values (e.g. "clamp" is 2):

```xml
  <!-- In ND_image_color3, u/vaddressmode have enum="constant,clamp,periodic,mirror" -->
  <implementation name="IM_image_color3_mystudio" nodedef="ND_image_color3" target="mystudio">
    <input name="uaddressmode" type="string"
      implname="extrapolate_u" impltype="integer" enumvalues="0, 2, 1, 3"/>
    <input name="vaddressmode" type="string"
      implname="extrapolate_v" impltype="integer" enumvalues="0, 2, 1, 3"/>
  </implementation>
```

```

This example defines two templates for a custom operator node called "mariBlend" (one operating on color3 values, and one operating on floats), and one template for a custom source node called "mariCustomNoise".  Implementations of these functions have been defined in both OSL and GLSL.  There is also in this example an alternate implementation of the "mariCustomNoise" function specifically for VRay, as if the author had determined that the generic OSL version was not appropriate for that renderer.

Here is an example of a two-output node definition and external implementation declaration.

```xml
  <nodedef name="ND_doublecolor_c3c3" node="doublecolor">
    <input name="in1" type="color3" value="0.0, 0.0, 0.0"/>
    <input name="seed" type="float" value="1.0"/>
    <output name="c1" type="color3" default="1.0, 1.0, 1.0"/>
    <output name="c2" type="color3" defaultinput="in1"/>
  </nodedef>
  <implementation name="IM_doublecolor_c3c3_osl" nodedef="ND_doublecolor_c3c3"
      file="lib/mtlx_funcs.osl" target="oslpattern"/>
```



### Custom Node Definition Using Node Graphs

Alternatively, a custom node's implementation may be described using a Node Graph.  A &lt;nodegraph> element wraps a graph of standard or custom nodes, taking the inputs and producing the output(s) described in the specified &lt;nodedef>.

A **&lt;nodegraph>** element consists of at least one node element and at least one &lt;output> element contained within a &lt;nodegraph> element.  Nodegraph elements may be one of two types: a **functional nodegraph**, which is the implementation of a node defined by a separate &lt;nodedef>, or a **compound nodegraph**, which is a set of nodes grouped together into a nodegraph container.  A functional nodegraph must either itself specify a `nodedef` attribute or be referenced by an &lt;implementation> element with a "nodegraph" attribute, while a compound nodegraph may do neither but may optionally specify one or more &lt;input> and/or &lt;token> elements.


#### Functional Nodegraphs

A **functional nodegraph** is a nodegraph-based implementation for a specified &lt;nodedef>, with the &lt;nodedef> declaring the set of inputs that the nodegraph accepts: a functional nodegraph may not itself specify any direct child input elements.

```xml
  <nodegraph name="graphname" nodedef="nodedefname" [target="target"]>
    ...node element(s)...
    ...output element(s)...
  </nodegraph>
```

or

```xml
  <nodegraph name="graphname">
    ...node element(s)...
    ...output element(s)...
  </nodegraph>
  <implementation name="implementationname" nodedef="nodedefname"
         nodegraph="graphname" [target="target"]/>
```

The type(s) of the &lt;output>(s) of the &lt;nodedef> and the type(s) of the nodegraph &lt;output>(s) must agree, and if there are multiple outputs, then the `name`s of the &lt;output>s in the &lt;nodegraph> and &lt;nodedef> must also agree.  The inputs and tokens of the &lt;nodedef> can be referenced within &lt;input> and &lt;token> elements of nodes within the nodegraph implementation using `interfacename` attributes in place of `value` or `nodename` attributes, e.g. a nodedef input "i2" and interface token "diffmap" could be referenced as follows:

```xml
    <input name="in2" type="color3" interfacename="i2"/>
    <token name="map1" type="string" interfacename="diffmap"/>
```

Note that a uniform &lt;input> of a node within the nodegraph may use `interfacename` to reference a uniform input in the nodedef, but it may not reference a non-uniform nodedef input.


#### Compound Nodegraphs

A **compound &lt;nodegraph>** element may specify one or more child &lt;input> and/or &lt;token> elements.  In this case, the &lt;nodegraph> functions as a collapsible "wrapper" for the contained nodes.

```xml
  <nodegraph name="graphname">
    [...input and/or token element(s)...]
    ...node and/or (compound) nodegraph element(s)...
    ...output element(s)...
  </nodegraph>
```

A compound nodegraph provides a set of named input and output connection ports which may be referenced by its contained nodes using `interfacename` attributes, and interface token names whose values may be substituted into filenames used within the nodegraph; nodes within this &lt;nodegraph> adopt the context of that nodegraph.  The &lt;input>s and &lt;token>s of a compound nodegraph may also be connected to other nodes outside the &lt;nodegraph> at the same scope as the &lt;nodegraph> itself using `nodename` attributes; inputs of nodes within a compound nodegraph may only be connected to the outputs of other nodes within the same compound nodegraph, or to the input connection ports using interfacename.   This is in contrast to a &lt;backdrop> node whose contained nodes connect directly to nodes outside the backdrop at the same level of context without going through an intermediate named &lt;input>.  A &lt;nodegraph> element of this form may specify the same float `width` and `height` and boolean `minimized` attributes as &lt;backdrop> nodes.  Inputs of other nodes, or the inputs of a compound nodegraph, can connect to an output of a (different) compound nodegraph using a `nodegraph` attribute (and for multiple-output compound nodegraphs, an `output` attribute as well) on a node's &lt;input>.

It is permissible to define multiple nodegraph- and/or file-based implementations for a custom node for the same combination of input and output types, as long as the specified `version`/`target`/`format` combinations are unique, e.g. one implementation for target "oslpattern" and another for "glsl", or one "osl" target with `format="shader"` and another with `format="fragment"`.  It is allowable for there to be both a &lt;nodegraph> and an &lt;implementation> for the same nodedef target/version, with the &lt;implementation> generally prevailing in order to allow for optimized native-code node implementations, although ultimately it would be up to the host application to determine which implementation to actually use.


#### Example Custom Node Defined by a Nodegraph

```xml
  <nodedef name="ND_blendadd_color4" node="blend_add">
    <input name="fg" type="color4" value="0,0,0,0"/>
    <input name="bg" type="color4" value="0,0,0,0"/>
    <input name="amount" type="float" value="1.0"/>
    <output name="out" type="color4" defaultinput="bg"/>
  </nodedef>
  <nodegraph name="NG_blendadd_color4" nodedef="ND_blendadd_color4">
    <multiply name="n1" type="color4">
      <input name="in1" type="color4" interfacename="fg"/>
      <input name="in2" type="float" interfacename="amount"/>
    </multiply>
    <add name="n2" type="color4">
      <input name="in1" type="color4" nodename="n1"/>
      <input name="in2" type="color4" interfacename="bg"/>
    </add>
    <output name="out" type="color4" nodename="n2"/>
  </nodegraph>
```

The inputs of the nodegraph are declared by the &lt;nodedef>, and the nodes within the nodegraph reference those inputs using `interfacename` attributes.  The "fg" and "bg" inputs provide default values which are used if an input is left unconnected when the custom node is used, and the "amount" input defines a default value which will be used if invocations of the node do not explicitly provide a value for "amount".


### Custom Node Use

Once defined with a &lt;nodedef>, using a custom node within a node graph follows the same syntax as any other standard node: the name of the element is the name of the custom node, and the MaterialX type of the node's output is required; the custom node's child elements define connections of inputs to other node outputs as well as any input values for the custom node.

```xml
  <mariCustomNoise name="custnoise1" type="color3">
    <input name="ColorA" type="color3" value="1.0, 1.0, 1.0"/>
    <input name="Size" type="float" value="0.5"/>
  </mariCustomNoise>
  <mariBlend name="customblend1" type="color3">
    <input name="in1" type="color3" nodename="custnoise1"/>
    <input name="in2" type="color3" value="0.3, 0.4, 0.66"/>
    <input name="ColorA" type="color3" value="1.0, 1.0, 0.9"/>
    <input name="ColorB" type="color3" value="0.2, 0.4, 0.6"/>
  </mariBlend>
```

When invoking nodes with multiple outputs, the `type` of the node should be declared as "multioutput", and other node inputs connecting to an output of the node must include an `output` attribute to specify which output of the node to connect to:

```xml
  <doublecolor name="dc1" type="multioutput">
    <input name="in1" type="color3" nodename="n0"/>
    <input name="seed" type="float" value="0.442367"/>
  </doublecolor>
  <contrast name="n1" type="color3">
    <input name="in" type="color3" nodename="dc1" output="c1"/>
    <input name="amount" type="float" value="0.14"/>
  </contrast>
  <add name="n2" type="color3">
    <input name="in1" type="color3" nodename="dc1" output="c2"/>
    <input name="in2" type="color3" nodename="n1"/>
  </add>
```



## Shader Nodes

Custom nodes that output data types with a "shader" semantic are referred to in MaterialX as "Shader Nodes".  Shaders, along with their inputs, are declared using the same &lt;nodedef>, &lt;implementation> and &lt;nodegraph> elements described above:

```xml
  <nodedef name="name" node="shaderfunctionname">
    ...input declarations...
    <output name="out" type="shadertype"/>
  </nodedef>
```

The attributes for &lt;nodedef> elements as they pertain to the declaration of shaders are:

* `name` (string, required): a user-chosen name for this shader node definition element.  
* `node` (string, required): the name of the shader node being defined, which typically matches the name of an associated shader function such as “blinn_phong”, “disney_principled”, “volumecloud_vol”.  Just as for custom nodes, this shading program may be defined precisely through an &lt;implementation> or &lt;nodegraph>, or left to the application to locate by name using any shader definition method that it chooses.

The child &lt;output> element within the &lt;nodedef> defines the "data type" of the output for this shader, which must have been defined with a "shader" semantic; see the [Custom Data Types](#custom-data-types) section above and discussion below for details.

NodeDef elements defining shader nodes do not typically include `default` or `defaultinput` attributes, though they are permitted using the syntax described in the [Custom Data Types](#custom-data-types) section if the output type of the shader node is not a blind data type.

As mentioned in the [Custom Data Types](#custom-data-types) section earlier, the standard MaterialX distribution includes the following standard data types for shaders:

```xml
  <typedef name="surfaceshader" semantic="shader" context="surface"/>
  <typedef name="volumeshader" semantic="shader" context="volume"/>
  <typedef name="displacementshader" semantic="shader" context="displacement"/>
  <typedef name="lightshader" semantic="shader" context="light"/>
```

These types all declare that they have "shader" semantic, but define different contexts in which a rendering target should interpret the output of the shader node.  For a shading language based on deferred lighting computations (e.g. OSL), a shader-semantic data type is equivalent to a radiance closure.  For a shading language based on in-line lighting computations (e.g. GLSL), a shader-semantic data type is equivalent to the final output values of the shader.

Instantiation of shader nodes to give them specific values is done the same way as instantiating any other node type:

```xml
  <unified_srf name="blueplasticsrf">
    <input name="diffColor" type="color3" value="0.04,0.12,0.64"/>
    <input name="specColor" type="color3" value="0.1,0.1,0.1"/>
    <input name="specRoughness" type="float" value="0.16"/>
  </unified_srf>
```

Instantiated shader nodes can also inherit from other shader nodes of the same class:

```xml
  <unified_srf name="glossyblueplasticsrf" inherit="blueplasticsrf">
    <input name="specRoughness" type="float" value="0.005"/>
  </unified_srf>
```

Declarations of shader node source implementations are accomplished using either &lt;implementation> elements for external source file declarations, or functional nodegraphs for nodegraph-based definitions.

As with non-shader custom nodes, **Input** elements are used within a &lt;nodedef> to declare the input ports for a shader node.

An input with a shader-semantic type may be given a value of "" to indicate no shader node is connected to this input; this is typically the default for shader-semantic inputs of operator nodes.  It is up to applications to decide what to do with unconnected shader-semantic inputs.

Please refer to [**Standard Shader Nodes**](./MaterialX.StandardNodes.md#standard-shader-nodes), [**Physically-Based Shading Nodes**](./MaterialX.PBRSpec.md) and [**NPR Shading Nodes**](./MaterialX.NPRSpec.md) for descriptions of Shader Nodes defined by MaterialX.



## Material Nodes

Custom nodes that output data types with a "material" semantic are referred to in MaterialX as "Material Nodes".  Material nodes typically have one or more "shader" semantic inputs which establish what shaders the material references; previous versions of MaterialX used &lt;shaderref> elements to establish these shader-to-material connections.  Material Nodes are declared using the same &lt;nodedef> elements as described above:

```xml
  <nodedef name="name" node="materialname">
    <input name="shaderinput1" type="shadertype" [target="target"]/>
    ...additional shader or input declarations...
    <output name="out" type="material"/>
  </nodedef>
```

The attributes for &lt;nodedef> elements as they pertain to the declaration of materials are:

* `name` (string, required): a user-chosen name for this material node definition element.  
* `node` (string, required): the name of the material node class being defined.

The standard MaterialX distribution includes a single material type definition used as the output type for all material nodes:

```xml
  <typedef name="material" semantic="material"/>
```

as well as definitions for three standard material nodes, all outputting type "material":

<a id="node-surfacematerial"> </a>

* **`surfacematerial`**: a surface shading material.
    * `surfaceshader` (surfaceshader): the name of the surfaceshader node.
    * `backsurfaceshader` (surfaceshader): the name of the surfaceshader node to be used for the back surface of an object, if the geometry is two-sided.  Default is "", meaning the `surfaceshader` shader will be used for both sides of a surface if the geometry is two-sided.
    * `displacementshader` (displacementshader): the name of the displacementshader node to use; default is "" for no displacement.

<a id="node-volumematerial"> </a>

* **`volumematerial`**: a volume shading material.
    * `volumeshader` (volumeshader): the name of the volumeshader node.

<a id="node-lightmaterial"> </a>

* **`lightmaterial`**: a light shader material.
    * `lightshader` (lightshader): the name of the lightshader node.

Material nodes supporting multiple shaders of the same type for different rendering targets can be defined:

```xml
  <nodedef name="ND_surfacematerialmulti" node="surfacematerialmulti">
    <input name="surfaceshader" type="surfaceshader" value=""/>
    <input name="displacementshader" type="displacementshader" value=""/>
    <input name="glslsurface" type="surfaceshader" value="" target="glsl"/>
    <input name="rmansurface" type="surfaceshader" value="" target="rman"/>
    <input name="rmandisplacement" type="displacementshader" value="" target="rman"/>
    <output name="out" type="material"/>
  </nodedef>
```

Creating materials with specific values bound to shader inputs involves instantiating a Shader Node for each desired shader type and setting values on those shader nodes, and connecting the shader node(s) to the inputs of a Material Node:

```xml
  <standard_surface name="goldsrf" type="surfaceshader">
    <input name="base" type="float" value="1"/>
    <input name="base_color" type="color3" value="0.944, 0.776, 0.373"/>
    <input name="specular" type="float" value="1"/>
    <input name="specular_color" type="color3" value="0.998, 0.981, 0.751"/>
    <input name="specular_roughness" type="float" value="0.02"/>
    <input name="metalness" type="float" value="1"/>
  </standard_surface>
  <surfacematerial name="Mgold" type="material">
    <input name="surfaceshader" type="surfaceshader" nodename="goldsrf"/>
  </surfacematerial>
```

Alternatively, and perhaps more usefully, a complete network of multiple shader nodes of different types or for different targets along with a material node to collect them all can be packaged within a nodegraph, and the various inputs of the shader nodes and any other nodes connected to their inputs can be connected to a single material nodedef interface to provide parameter values for the entire multi-shader network.  Because nodedef inputs can be referenced by more than one node, a single unified interface could be created for several shaders for different targets, and the networks for those targets could contain input value conversion nodes as needed to handle differences in parametrization or shading methodologies.


#### Example Pre-Shader Compositing Material

A material to blend between three different surface layers using mask textures.  This example also demonstrates the use of the "target" attribute of a shader implementation element to define multiple renderer-specific shaders of the same type referenced within a single material, and the use of interface tokens to define texture filenames.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

       uses a simple nodegraph wrapper around standard_surface, while the
       second uses an external implementation, is specific to the target
       "rmanris" and uses "implname" to remap the parameter names.  The
       surface shader allows mixing of the diffuse color with a texture.

## Material Variants

A Variant is a container for any number of uniform values for material inputs and interface tokens.  One or more mutually-exclusive variants are defined as part of a &lt;variantset>; variants may not be defined outside of a &lt;variantset>.

```xml
  <variantset name="wetvars">
    <variant name="wet1">
      <token name="diffmap" type="string" value="diff_wet1"/>
      <token name="specmap" type="string" value="spec_wet1"/>
      <input name="roughness" type="float" value="0.001"/>
    </variant>
    ...additional <variant> declarations for this variantset...
  </variantset>
```

&lt;Input> elements within a &lt;variant> may only define a `value`, not a connection to a node or &lt;output>.

Example uses for variants include defining a number of allowable colors and texture tokens for different costume variations, and defining values for progressively increasing levels of damage to a model.

Variants and variantsets are not intrinsically associated with any particular material; they merely state a number of values for a number of named inputs/tokens.  However, variantsets may state that they are associated with specific shader-semantic nodes and/or &lt;nodedef> declarations by providing stringarray-type `node` and/or `nodedef` attributes:

```xml
  <variantset name="costumevars" nodedef="ND_unifiedsrf_studio">
    ...
```

Variants and variantsets can be defined in any MaterialX implementation, but because variants are applied to materials within a &lt;look>, they can only be applied in applications supporting MaterialX Geometry Extensions; please see the [**VariantAssign Elements**](./MaterialX.GeomExts.md#variantassign-elements) section in that document for information on using material variants.
