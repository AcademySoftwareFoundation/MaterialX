README for 1.37 archive folder
----->


This folder would contain the markdown or pdf files for a specific "archived" version of the spec, in this case 1.37.  In reality, we may not want to keep more than one archived version; just the latest one before the current version.  Older versions of PDF spec files can be archived on materialx.org.
