MaterialX Python API Documentation
==================================

The MaterialX Python API provides Python bindings for the
`MaterialX C++ API <https://materialx.org/docs/api/>`_ .

MaterialX is an open standard for representing rich material and look-development
content in computer graphics, enabling its platform-independent description and
exchange across applications and renderers. Launched at `Industrial Light & Magic
<https://www.ilm.com/>`_ in 2012, MaterialX has been a key technology in their
feature films and real-time experiences since *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*
and *Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run*. The project was released as open source
in 2017, with companies including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Pixar, Autodesk,
Adobe, and SideFX contributing to its ongoing development. In 2021, MaterialX
became the seventh hosted project of the `Academy Software Foundation
<https://www.aswf.io/>`_ .

General information about MaterialX, announcements, events, third-party support,
and contributing to MaterialX is available at
`MaterialX.org <https://materialx.org/>`_ .
