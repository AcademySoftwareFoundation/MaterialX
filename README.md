MaterialX is an open standard for transfer of rich material and look-development content between applications and renderers.  Originated at Lucasfilm in 2012, MaterialX has been used by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) in feature films such as _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ and real-time experiences such as _Trials on Tatooine_, and it remains the central material format for new ILM productions.

### Quick Start for Developers

- Download the latest version of theÂ [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system.
- Point CMake to the root of the MaterialX library and generate C++ projects for your platform and compiler.
- Select the `MATERIALX_BUILD_PYTHON` option to build Python bindings.

### Supported Platforms

The MaterialX codebase requires a compiler with support for C++11, and can be built with any of the following:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or newer
- GCC 4.8 or newer
- Clang 3.3 or newer

The Python bindings for MaterialX are based on [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11), and currently support Python versions 2.6, 2.7, and 3.x.

### Repository

The MaterialX repository consists of the following folders:

    documents - The MaterialX specification, developer guide, and example files.
    source    - A cross-platform C++ library for MaterialX with Python bindings.
                The MaterialXCore module supports the core MaterialX elements
                and graph traversal, while the MaterialXFormat module supports
                XML serialization.
    python    - Support modules for MaterialX Python.

## ADSK Contribution Workflow

### Setup remote names
As setup the following remotes should be set up: (git remote -v)

- Public fork:
```
 public_fork  https://github.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX.git (fetch)
 public_fork  https://github.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX.git (push)
```

- Private fork
```
private_fork    https://git.autodesk.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX (fetch)
private_fork    https://git.autodesk.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX (push)
```

- ILM master
```
upstream        https://github.com/materialx/MaterialX (fetch)
upstream        /// ATTENTION ///   Are you sure you want to push to public github.com? To override this warning run: 'git adsk enable-public-push github.com/materialx/MaterialX (push)
```

Remotes can be added using this syntax:
```
git remote add <desired-name> <remote-location.git>
git fetch fetch
```

### Update from upstream master
When working on a ADSK contribution make sure to update your branch to the latest ILM master
```
git pull upstream master
```

Note that 'master' on both the private and public fork cannot be modified so the pull should be to a local branch.
In the private fork, this should be branched off of the
```
adsk/master
```
branch. *Never* try and delete the adsk/master branch.

If doing your work in the private fork, and it makes sense update adsk/master and branch from there.
Otherwise create a new branch in the public fork.

### Synchonrizing code between public and private forks
If working in a private branch then the changes can be cherry-picked to the pubiic branch and vice versa:
```
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

### Code reviews
All code will need to be reviewed by ILM so all changes must eventually be put into a public fork branch.
It may be best to just pass the diff to ILM first before creaing a pull request. Once a pull request is done,
then ILM's CI system will be invoked. Comment the review as necessary and naturally fix an errors found during CI.

### Building and Testing
There are yaml files which define the build process. Make sure to run those build steps instead of / or just
building and testing locally. See 
```
.appyveyor.yml 
```
for Windows, and 
```
.travis.yml 
```
for Linux and Mac. 

The CI build will run build and test on all the platforms specified.

To build the full set of items the following cmake variables should be defined
* MATERIALX_BUILD_DOCS=ON
* MATERIALX_BUILD_MAYA_EXPORTER=ON
* MATERIALX_BUILD_PYTHON=ON
* MATERIALX_INSTALL_PYTHON=ON
* MATERIALX_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON
* MAYA_DEBUG_DIR=```<run-time path to Maya>```
* MAYA_RELEASE_DIR=```<run-time path to Maya>```

#### Remote build testing

Travis and appveyor environments have been set up / tested to build only with https://github.com/autodesk-forks/MaterialX/ .
In particular adsk_update should be the branch to build.

It is not allowed to public private forks nor autodesk git repos so for testing all changes should be placed here first for basic platform sanity checking, *before* sending a pull request to ILM. Note that no h/w graphics tests can be performed since the build machines have no graphics on them. TBD if/how can work around this.

* For Travis: https://travis-ci.org/autodesk-forks/MaterialX/
* For Appveyor: It seems you need to set up a personal project based on log-in. 
** Sign in appveyor.com and add a project. autodesk-forks, materialx should show up if you have permission to this repo. e.g. https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bernardkwok/materialx-2k4yy.
** TBD if can set up a shared project.

#### Local build testing

It is supposed to be possible to run Travis/appveyor yaml scripts on a local machine. TBD exact steps but appears Docker
must be set up locally. It is easy to extract scrupts from the yaml files as the build steps are pretty simple. An
example is below which also builds Maya dependencies (not part of public fork).
```
mkdir build_public_release
cd build_public_release
cmake -DMATERIALX_BUILD_PYTHON=ON -DMATERIALX_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON -DMATERIALX_BUILD_DOCS=ON -DMATERIALX_BUILD_MAYA_EXPORTER=ON -DMAYA_DEBUG_DIR="D:\Work\maya_cuts\mainline-2cd3ff87c4-201711091615-RUNTIME\runTime" -DMAYA_RELEASE_DIR="D:\Work\maya_cuts\mainline-2cd3ff87c4-201711091615-RUNTIME\runTime" -G "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" ..
cmake --build . --target install --config Release
ctest -VV --debug --output-on-failure --build-config Release
cmake -E chdir ../python/MaterialXTest python main.py
```

### Coding standards
Make sure to follow the Pixar/ILM coding standards.
