MaterialX is an open standard for transfer of rich material and look-development content between applications and renderers.  Originated at Lucasfilm in 2012, MaterialX has been used by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) in feature films such as _Star Wars: The Force Awakens_ and real-time experiences such as _Trials on Tatooine_, and it remains the central material format for new ILM productions.

### Quick Start for Developers

-   Download the latest version of theÂ [CMake](https://cmake.org/) build system.
-   Point CMake to the root of the MaterialX library and generate C++ projects for your platform and compiler.
-   Select the `MATERIALX_BUILD_PYTHON` option to build Python bindings.

### Supported Platforms

The MaterialX codebase requires a compiler with support for C++11, and can be built with any of the following:

-   Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or newer
-   GCC 4.8 or newer
-   Clang 3.3 or newer

The Python bindings for MaterialX are based on [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11), and currently support Python versions 2.6, 2.7, and 3.x.
